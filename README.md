# GlycoSeq
A research project in C#

- MultiGlycan is an open source software MutiGlycan to analyze complex glycomic samples using high-throughput LC-MS/MS.
- The software is capable of determining glycosylation sites on protein and identifying isomeric glycans of glycoproteins
from tendem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data (e.g. ETDhcD). 
 - It is easy to use with graphic user interface (GUI) on Window and fast to run with multi-threading support.
